# Minecraft Stack Size Converter

This is a simple command-line tool coded in Python.  
This is the first command-line tool I've ever created.

## How to use

1. Make sure the provided files are unzipped and are all contained in the same file (preferably titled "mssg").
2. In Environment Variables add the location to the file you just created.
3. Its ready to go, in CMD run [ `mssg <number of items to convert>` ] and it will output the stack sizes needed, including the amount of non-stack items needed.

## LTS

This is just a project I threw together to put Python on a resume and prove I know the basics.  
I really only use Python when I need something on the fly for lengthy mathematical equations I need to do.  
Don't expect many updates to this repo.
